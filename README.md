# Predicting Economic Recessions Using Economic Policy Uncertainty and Machine Learning
## Overview
Economic recessions have far-reaching consequences for global markets, influencing employment, inflation, interest rates, trade, and overall macroeconomic performance. In an era marked by heightened geopolitical tensions and uncertainty—such as Brexit and recent U.S. elections—the need for robust and early recession forecasting tools has become more urgent.

This interdisciplinary research project combines macroeconomics and machine learning to develop predictive models that identify early indicators of economic downturns, with a particular focus on Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU). The project is a collaboration between student researchers and faculty experts in macroeconomics and business analytics.

## Goals
- Use EPU indices and key macroeconomic indicators to build accurate recession forecasting models.

- Apply advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, LSTM) to model non-linear and high-dimensional data.

- Improve model interpretability through SHAP values and Partial Dependence Plots.

- Assess the macroeconomic impact of recent U.S. elections and tariff policies through the lens of EPU.

- Provide student researchers with hands-on experience in applied machine learning for economic analysis.
